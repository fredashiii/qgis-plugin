## Developer Notes
* Use QtCreator to modify the .ui file.
    * Depending on the version of QtCreator and the version of QGIS, Qt may add some things to the file that are not compatible. Qt is most useful to add additional widgets or adjust layout.
* For Smarty deployment, push changes to the repo and have ops deploy to the QGIS plugin repository.
